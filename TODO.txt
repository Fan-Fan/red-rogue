			ladders
			ledges
			traps
			chaos walls
		races

AI issues:
	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

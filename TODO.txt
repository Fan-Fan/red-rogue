Change log: Created Horror Character as part of FEAR Effect, fixed bug in Missile where effects would be applied to Stones, removed dive node usage from flee() due to confusion

Bug hunt
	can crash graph renderer by changing level	
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	minion summon after death? - unreproducable
	combo bug: minion, indifference, level 21, identify monster twice, minion portal - unreproducable
	
	goblin dither on stairs
	
create Editor in debug menu
	create option
		map features
			traps
			chaos walls
		items

hide a plus one mace in a secret room above the grindstone

animate the trap marker - it should bling in the level when searched

create enchant option item menu

Tackle the AI problem
		
	Fear spell
		create Shade Characters (no-clip, tint black, alpha'd, drain health of target, same race as target)
		Shade object class
			accepts a character to construct
			moves at half speed
			slides instead of animating
			generates DripFX
			
	Confusion spell

	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

AI issues:

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		expand room defined areas
		drop monsters into rooms only (or in certain zones - other areas as well)
		create context groups for monsters in packs
		create an xp pool per level and subtract monsters and level content from it to control progression

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying
	create smited state for all characters

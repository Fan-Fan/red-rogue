Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)

AI issues:
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles
	give Map, Content and DungeonMap their own XorRandom object to create seedable dungeons


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

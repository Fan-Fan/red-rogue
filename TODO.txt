Bug hunt
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	minion dither spotted - could not reach target above
		perhaps implement line of sight checking to verify target is still accessible
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)
	
	protection reflected missiles faulty - test with gun leech
	new game is broken - calling new game in overworld erases overworld content
		content stocks need to stop being emptied


endings
	epilogue
		write endings
	quest menu - picking up yendor
		change to return to overworld
		change to go home

Change log: refactored portals and set-level to work generic with target-level and target-type, pocket dungeons now support portals to the overworld and underworld

Bug hunt
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	full crash observed in chaos - game frozen, menu operational
	
	patrol bug spotted - a monster will become frozen in its patrol cycle
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	shot troll with arrow - no aggro, why? - possible frozen monster occurence
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)


exit reveal not going to work on big maps - solve
	create feature hash in minimap
	reveal by type

pocket portals broken

	pocket dungeon not supporting more than one portal - why?


	issues:
		altars make it possible to open a portal in pocket
		the underworld portal can be opened in pocket
		monster quanitity at higher levels not yet tested
	solution:
		refactor the Portal class to handle target-map-type and target-level
			split type into
				stairs, portal, monster portal
			change direction arrow to be a separate attachable clip?
			change background to be a separate attachable clip?
				- or have both as clips that can be set to a given frame?
			check it works with debug

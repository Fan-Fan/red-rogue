Change log: quest for yendor now completes when yendor is picked up and an ascend quest is issued, instantiation of the yendor quest is not a duty of the UserData gameState, epilogue 1st draft finished, fixed bug caused by avoiding chests on stairs (resulting in not placing a chest and making the level uncompletable), restricted fall-camera-pan-down to when in WALKING state

Bug hunt
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	minion dither spotted - could not reach target above
		perhaps implement line of sight checking to verify target is still accessible
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)
	
	protection reflected missiles faulty - test with gun leech
	resetting screwing with transition

Sounds
	stomp stun head contact
	short search
	polymorph
	dungeon death
	balrog death?
	polish
	cheap osx tool for editing dead air out of samples

Bug hunt
	can crash graph renderer by changing level	
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	minion summon after death? - unreproducable
	combo bug: minion, indifference, level 21, identify monster twice, minion portal - unreproducable

create Editor in debug menu
	create option
		map features
			traps
			chaos walls
		items

level complete prompt
	creating quest gems or monsters will bump the completion count

refactor "Map" or "Dungeon" terminology - having both is just confusing

hide a plus one mace in a secret room above the grindstone

animate the trap marker - it should bling in the level when searched

Tackle the AI problem
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path
			
	no clip handling
		fear out of tile?
		
	someone in the way
		infect target and emotional state
	
	the dither bug
		*may be solved
	



	Fear spell
	Confusion spell

AI issues:
	




	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
		path caching - would that solve the problem, if the ai could rememeber where they were going?
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

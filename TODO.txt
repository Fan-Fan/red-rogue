Change log: quickening is delayed until a character is awake, player.quickenQueued wakes the player, stopped stairs spawning next to secret walls, cleared levels are now marked "cleared" - allowing items to be left there without the minimap going dark again, changed stun/confusion/chaos armour effects to have variable delays like teleport armour, minimap now reveals stairs that are far away, fixed death by bleed effect crashing game

Bug hunt
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	full crash observed in chaos - game frozen, menu operational
	
	patrol bug spotted - a monster will become frozen in its patrol cycle
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	shot troll with arrow - no aggro, why? - possible frozen monster occurence
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall?)
	balrog death throws error when next changing level
	
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)

AI problems:
	climbing into monster's feet is a serious issue that needs a solution
		trigger drop attack?
		explore ladder?
	frozen monster syndrome
	escape graph imperfect
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

either the effect target reference is null or the effects list for the target is null


*the rune pass through has changed to a hit with no effect - still needs investigation

*pickup bug - very rarely an item will not get removed from the map when being picked up. Error throwing in place

thrown rune triggered wrong effect - investigate

clip renderer on small levels (background tiles show through underneath on odd sized small levels)

racial abilities - implement by having a personal effects list, add a new effect source - RACIAL:
	troll regeneration
	shadow monster - all walls are ledges

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		where to place monsters
		where to place chests
		where to place traps

the overworld (accessible from level 1 and portals):
	backdrop - single screen full colour (contrast to black and white dungeon)
	the grindstone
		code done - create graphic
	the healstone
		code done - create graphic

build demo 5

elaborate on previous milestones:
	more monsters - new monsters each level
	more items - shoes, crying, etc
	more runes - as many as I can think of
	more traps - same again
	boss fights - room blocking trolls and the macguffin holding demon
	balancing - call out for play testers
	more easter eggs (konami code and collosal cave code need to have their effect assigned)

move towards final build - update final build on a regular basis


EXTRA ELEMENTS TO DO:

	tutorial:
		the game needs a teaching mode
	
	title screen:
		
	
	ui:
		more apple:
			fade in and out the menu
			roll the console printer and set an event queue for print
			smooth roll the options and smoothly move the current selection left and right
				for left and right, we can have a screen grab of the menulist that's being discarded fade out in the slide and have the new menulist fade in
				for this I would create a transistion menu change (as well as a state change - rendering and state change would need to be isolated from each other - probably for the best I think)
				
	spells:
		confusion (flip controls - will require changing the key constants to internal variables, for the player, flip the screen also) - this could work as a charm spell on monsters, making them additional minions
		haste (just need to boost attack times and movement speed)
		slow (just need to cripple attack times and movement speed)
		chaos (random effect, and will need to modify GameMenu to show random names)
		identify (detail information about monsters or the player or add a random ability to an item)
		thorns (reflect damage)
		power (attacks have a chance to throw the victim into a wall or other monsters)
		fear (overrides enemy AI - but what does it do to you? makes you hallucinate? that would be pretty funny)
		
	monsters:
		story - an old man that spouts lines of generative story to the console and bars the player's progress out of the first room until they kill him (story killed by rogue)
		wraiths - shadow monsters (can walk through walls)
		mimic (that chest just bit me!
			even better - high level mimics mimic stairways!)
		vampire (steals health and adds it to its own)
		leprechaun (steals items when it attacks)
		floating eyes (casts paralysis? - this is a dangerous effect to have as rune, maybe combo with slow)
		graded monsters (simply harder or weaker)
			ogre - big fucker, perhaps be bigger than corridors
			hobgoblins - bigger goblins
		umber hulk - insectoid monster with confusion attack
		slimes - worse than kobolds?
		tengu - teleporting demon
		balrog - a red character, players should shit themselves when confronted with one
		
		champion monsters (how do I illustrate this?), will possess magic items and can rally surrounding monsters to mob the player
		
	sounds:
		menu move - can get around chained menu actions by having a sound toggle in the menu code
		
	graphics:
		background wall features
		foreground (would I be able to render the fx before the tile layers? it seems the only way it could work)
		random detritus (could it go on the block layer without harming it?)
		
	ai:
		rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player
		
	help:
	
	stats:
		should the items and characters be reading their base stats and per level stats from something
		like an xml file? Or am I just going to end up dumping all the xml into pretty much what I've got
		in the classes already?

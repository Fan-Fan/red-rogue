AI problems:

		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		expand room defined areas
		drop monsters into rooms only (or in certain zones - other areas as well)
		create context groups for monsters in packs

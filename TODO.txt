Change log: fixed bug with portals not executing main() when reinstated by MapTileManager, save and quit functional - appears stable, round of bug fixing before upload

Bug hunt
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	full crash observed in chaos - game frozen, menu operational
	
	patrol bug spotted - a monster will become frozen in its patrol cycle
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	shot troll with arrow - no aggro, why? - possible frozen monster occurence
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall?)
	balrog death throws error when next changing level
	permanent stun lock in werewolf race (stun effect + melee stun + stomp stun?)
	level clearing not permanent - delete all content stocks for a level? or mark a level complete (item dropping)?
	level up whilst sleeping crashes game?
	
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)

AI problems:
	climbing into monster's feet is a serious issue that needs a solution
		trigger drop attack?
		explore ladder?
	frozen monster syndrome
	escape graph imperfect
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

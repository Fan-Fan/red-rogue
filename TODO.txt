Change log: changed Effect.teleportCharacter to call Brain.clear on all NPCs, added silent teleport to teleportCharacter for positioning Balrog in level, changed usage of Effect.teleportCharacter where redundant calls to getTeleportTarget were used, removed balrog racial attack (character already very powerful, plus he can generate golems via chaos wall destruction)

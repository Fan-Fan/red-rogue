Change log: added summon minion queueing to limit summons to stable occasions, added teleport to exit debug options, fixed portal lists not being extended in infinite dungeon, added konami code lives cheat

Bug hunt
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	minion summon after death? - unreproducable
	combo bug: minion, indifference, level 21, identify monster twice, minion portal

make console print outs for effects optional (due to dismiss-apply chains when changing race)

konami code for lives

remove editor render layer when not in use

stop walk animation/moving when pushing wall

deprecate count from Effect.apply()?
	
interstitial transitions - fade to some text, then fade to the scene


create Editor in debug menu
	create launch test bed option
	set current dungeon level (affects dungeon level)
	create option
		map features
			walls
			ladders
			ledges
			traps
			chaos walls
		races
		items

AI issues:
	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

Change log: fixed protection not changing ownership of reflected missiles, characters get bored of chasing targets that aren't in line of sight

Bug hunt
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)

effect status anims (called at end of render):
	tracking FX?
	thorns spikes
	protection


Sounds
	dry swallow (eat rune)
	munch (eat heart)
	stomp stun head contact
	holy/prayer sound
	short search sound (half duration of standard search sound)
	polymorph
	dungeon death (preferably a group of samples that can be randomised)
	balrog death?
	cheap osx tool for editing dead air out of samples (some samples need snipping like the teleport sounds and I can manage this myself)
	polish - to be applied once all the samples are in (feedback on volumes of all sounds, general nitpicking)

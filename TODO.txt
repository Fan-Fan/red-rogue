thorns rune

portal rune

AI issues:
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	can get stuck on the edge of a ledge where the character's center point is not inside a node
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles

rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

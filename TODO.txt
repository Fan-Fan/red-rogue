Bug hunt
	shooting a secret wall causing multiple "secret revealed" messages - unreproducable
	undead unequip bug - unreproducible?
	apparent bug with attacking a quickening character
	throwing a rune at a wall issue - runes should bounce off walls i think

	chaos wall bug - set up test bed to column drop monster on to chaos walls


prep for identify rune
	Lore menu
	*Reveal minimap - MiniMap.reveal()
	*Identify all runes - InventoryMenuList.identifyRunes()
	Quests

Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)

AI issues:
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

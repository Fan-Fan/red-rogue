Change log: fixed random seed input not updating correctly, camera is center locked on levels that aren't as wide as the screen (solves camera bugging out in this situation), camera y axis lookahead now smaller, camera y lookahead pans down when falling, added male rogue as an extra race, added rules for coloured male rogue on overworld

Bug hunt
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)
	investigate portals around level 20 plus and killing the balrog in the same area

Change log: fixed toggle options not showing keys they're assigned to when not in first state, created UserData object for saving game settings and data - deprecates QuickSave class (behaviour from said class to be rolled into UserData in near future), game now saves settings and initialises using UserData class

	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	full crash observed in chaos - game frozen, menu operational
	
	patrol bug spotted - a monster will become frozen in its patrol cycle
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	shot troll with arrow - no aggro, why? - possible frozen monster occurence
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)

AI problems:

		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

Change log: fixed security restriction error when saving settings, revised sniping ai (discovered clause that makes snipers freeze when above targets, added defaulting to hand 2 hand combat when too close), added sanity check when destroying chaos walls (may not have solved invisible walls in Chaos), story tidied up post proof-reading

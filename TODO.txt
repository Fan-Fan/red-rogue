Change log: wearing balrog's face ending implemented, hard reset implemented, player no longer receives xp after death, balrog attempts to escape to the next level if fleeing - answers using quickening to attack him, teleport now creates distanced sounds at the departure and arrival points

Bug hunt
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)


Guide -
	copy over races guide for elites (check racial bonuses are accurate), then fill out

rotate between a selection of menus
	title screen

endings

AI problems:
	escape graph imperfect
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

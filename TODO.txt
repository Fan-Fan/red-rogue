Tackle the AI problem
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		panic paths
			player must cross center of start node
	no clip handling
	someone in the way
	the dither bug
	



	Fear spell
	Confusion spell

AI issues:
	




	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
		path caching - would that solve the problem, if the ai could rememeber where they were going?
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

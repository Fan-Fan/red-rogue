AI problems:
	escape graph imperfect
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

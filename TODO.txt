Change log: chakram spins now, thrown weapons are visible when thrown from ladders, fixed helmet and indifference forward facing graphics

Bug hunt
	throwing a rune at a wall issue - runes should bounce off walls i think
	minion got stuck on stairs
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	all of a sudden, many sound effects - why?
	
	missile riding
		remove top and bottom surfaces?
	

redo leech mechanic?
	blood armour prevents leech - cannot be leech enchanted
	leech spell:
		eat: leech weapon
		enchant weapon: leech bonus
		enchant armour: reduce max health, cursed
		throw: leech weapon

wrong frame facing forward on helmet

remove editor render layer when not in use

stop walk animation/moving when pushing wall

deprecate count from Effect.apply()?

deprecate return type from equip? (from weapon stacking days?)
	
interstitial transitions - fade to some text, then fade to the scene


Issues with offhand:
	leech stat stacking
	buff stacking?
	new menu option format for weapons and armour




create Editor in debug menu
	create launch test bed option
	set current dungeon level (affects dungeon level)
	create option
		map features
			walls
			ladders
			ledges
			traps
			chaos walls
		races
		items

AI issues:
	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

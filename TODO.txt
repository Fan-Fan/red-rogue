Change log: solved more issues with AI vs gates due to gates moving off the AI graph, jumping AI for combat installed - jumping for path finding would require a new graph (perhaps can do without), increased decapitation velocity

Bug hunt
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	full crash observed in chaos - game frozen, menu operational
	
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	shot troll with arrow - no aggro, why? - possible frozen monster occurence
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	balrog death throws error when next changing level
	
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)

secret items
	chest col
		put a chest on the overworld grindstone, put one secret item in it
	leech gun
	fez
	bug
	fishbane

	the balrog

the balrog
	balrog corpse

Guide -
	copy over races guide for elites (check racial bonuses are accurate), then fill out

	title screen
		title menu


split story into tips.json and story.json - add tips to writings on new games
	degrade writings further into dungeon

split dreams.json into nightmares.json and dreams.json - introduce nightmares entering caves

endings

AI problems:
	escape graph imperfect
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

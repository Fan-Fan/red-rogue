Change log: fixed being able to circumvent cursed items with throwing weapons and bow weapons, reduced number of levels (each zone up to chaos now has three levels - one of them reduced to 2 levels), grindstone xp reduced to 1/2 xp per hit, rewrote some story and dreams

Bug hunt
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	

allow areas to be used to hack the identification game by leaving identified runes there

Sounds
	dry swallow (eat rune)
	munch (eat heart)
	stomp stun head contact
	holy/prayer sound
	short search sound (half duration of standard search sound)
	polymorph
	dungeon death (preferably a group of samples that can be randomised)
	balrog death?
	cheap osx tool for editing dead air out of samples (some samples need snipping like the teleport sounds and I can manage this myself)
	polish - to be applied once all the samples are in (feedback on volumes of all sounds, general nitpicking)

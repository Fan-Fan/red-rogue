Bug hunt
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?

		perhaps implement line of sight checking to verify target is still accessible

	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)
	
	protection reflected missiles faulty - test with gun leech
	yendor can be left in overworld at end game
	resetting screwing with transition


endings

	quest menu - picking up yendor

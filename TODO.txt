Change log: combat hints added to story, identified runes left in areas will leave part of the identification game complete when a new game is started

Bug hunt
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	

trailer build with centre locked camera

separate menu rendering to save the mental health of anyone who maintains this

discontinue xml

Sounds
	dry swallow (eat rune)
	munch (eat heart)
	stomp stun head contact
	holy/prayer sound
	short search sound (half duration of standard search sound)
	polymorph
	dungeon death (preferably a group of samples that can be randomised)
	balrog death?
	cheap osx tool for editing dead air out of samples (some samples need snipping like the teleport sounds and I can manage this myself)
	polish - to be applied once all the samples are in (feedback on volumes of all sounds, general nitpicking)

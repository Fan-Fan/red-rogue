Change log: elite race now completely random (previous method never chose races from chaos zone), husband now opens overworld portal instead of underworld portal (after eating portal rune), fixed temporary portals erasing the background, added new altar blessing: clones, elite balrog now possesses 1 level of heal as racial effect (2 if player ascended), munch sound now played when soul consumed by balrog, fixed game breaking bug caused by invading chaos walls not integrating with the scrolling engine, umber hulk elite resurrection requirement lowered by one level

Bug hunt
	weapon on player and minion disappearing
		possible fix applied
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
		produced by chaos wall invasions not working with the map tile manager

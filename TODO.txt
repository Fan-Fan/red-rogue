Bug hunt
	can crash graph renderer by changing level	
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	minion summon after death? - unreproducable
	combo bug: minion, indifference, level 21, identify monster twice, minion portal - unreproducable
	
create Editor in debug menu
	create option
		map features
			traps
			chaos walls
		items

hide a plus one mace in a secret room above the grindstone

animate the trap marker - it should bling in the level when searched

create enchant option item menu

Tackle the AI problem
			
	Confusion spell - add stun status graphic to confused characters
		player: flip screen, flip controls
		monster: periodically switch from chase to flee to patrol
			add confusion count to monster ai
			
		add confusion to werewolf

	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

AI issues:

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		expand room defined areas
		drop monsters into rooms only (or in certain zones - other areas as well)
		create context groups for monsters in packs
		create an xp pool per level and subtract monsters and level content from it to control progression

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying
	create smited state for all characters

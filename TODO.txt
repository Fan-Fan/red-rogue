	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)
	investigate portals around level 20 plus and killing the balrog in the same area

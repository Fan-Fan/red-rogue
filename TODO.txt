Change log: corrected "poison" references in Lore, balrog now equipped with random weapon, anubis now equipped with undead enchanted armour, added top edge interval tolerance to Collider map tests

Bug hunt
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	minion dither spotted - could not reach target above
		perhaps implement line of sight checking to verify target is still accessible
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	minion weapon invisible after level change (arbalest and skull equipped)
	investigate portals around level 20 plus and killing the balrog in the same area

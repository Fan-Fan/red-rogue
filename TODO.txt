Bug hunt
	throwing a rune at a wall issue - runes should bounce off walls i think
	minion got stuck on stairs
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	teleport sound bug - all of a sudden, many sound effects - why?
	
	
add throw command to throwable items?
	offhandthrowing weapons

wrong frame facing forward on helmet

remove editor render layer when not in use

stop walk animation/moving when pushing wall

deprecate count from Effect.apply()?
	
interstitial transitions - fade to some text, then fade to the scene

create Editor in debug menu
	create launch test bed option

	create option
		map features
			walls

AI issues:
	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
	walks into wall constantly when too close
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying

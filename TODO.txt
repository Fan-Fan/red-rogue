Change log: fixed bug with lives available with konami cheat, moved underworld portal starting position back to level 11, reorganised wall writings, moved gfx updating of equipment to render function - layer updates are now called by setting the value of an update marker to the current game.frameCount (this should ensure that any graphics changes happen in an orderly sequence)

Bug hunt
	weapon on player and minion disappearing
		possible fix applied
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
		added collider.world check on death - cannot reproduce this AT ALL

AI problems:

	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		expand room defined areas
		drop monsters into rooms only (or in certain zones - other areas as well)
		create context groups for monsters in packs
		create an xp pool per level and subtract monsters and level content from it to control progression

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying
	create smited state for all characters

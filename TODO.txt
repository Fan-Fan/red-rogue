Change log: fixed swallow sound delay, minion now makes eating noises, xp rune now adds 1-3 levels when enchanting, settings can now be saved to a file from the debug menu, Balrog is now one level higher than normal after the player has ascended, tempCollider now nullified in Collider move functions to prevent references staying alive

Bug hunt
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall? or chaos wall?)
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)
	sniper behaviour too cowardly
	weapon on player and minion disappearing
	catastrophic ai faliure with sniper - if sniper is above target it can get in a multiple path loop

Change log: contact with a character's leader now draws aggro (minion will rush to rogue's aid), player allies no longer attack any gates other than RAISE gates, monsters now check for being in one tile wide enclosures to drop out of (prevents monsters ladder camping after fleeing), monsters now explore ladders randomly (solves monsters patrolling in pits and circulates population), patrolState replaces patrolAreaSet

Bug hunt
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	chaos wall colliders can child a character and pull it into a wall - how?
	null Monster collider.world spotted - why?
	full crash observed in chaos - game frozen, menu operational
	
	minion dither spotted - caught in a probable follow/avoid loop
	shot troll with arrow - no aggro, why? - possible frozen monster occurence
	balrog frozen after smite attack, stuck to wall - no further info (perhaps secret wall?)
	balrog death throws error when next changing level
	
	chaos walls frozen without graphics rendered and no walls beneath them (activated, not on chaos wall render list?)

AI problems:
	escape graph imperfect
	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path
	rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

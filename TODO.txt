Change log: removed redundant state settings in Character, added diving node connections to AI, altered Brain routines to fit new regime, bravery stat implemented (fast characters with low bravery do a bravery check to stay in combat)

Bug hunt
	can crash graph renderer by changing level	
	collection lock out on chests after playing for a while - bugged chest or item?
	minion summon after death? - unreproducable
	combo bug: minion, indifference, level 21, identify monster twice, minion portal - unreproducable
	
create Editor in debug menu
	create option
		map features
			traps
			chaos walls
		items

hide a plus one mace in a secret room above the grindstone

animate the trap marker - it should bling in the level when searched

move enchant to item menu?

Tackle the AI problem
		
	Fear spell
		create Shade Characters (no-clip, tint black, alpha'd, drain health of target, same race as target)
		Shade object class
			accepts a character to construct
			moves at half speed
			slides instead of animating
			generates DripFX
			
	Confusion spell

	meta-heuristic block - path too long
		genius chase solver backup graph
			genius class
			priority queue
			slow path

AI issues:
	




	Add some how add a random offset to AI search values - they're in ints (fuck knows, coin flipping?)
		path caching - would that solve the problem, if the ai could rememeber where they were going?
	monster AI jitter on ladder observed - investigate
	possible dithering when a monster may get caught between meta-heuristic paths of equal value
	bravery - monster makes so many attacks before retreating for a while
	chasing monster getting stuck on patrolling monster
	explore - monsters should check out ladders when alone

help on menu has not been fully written out

level generator overhaul:
	distribution tactics -
		distribution bubbles


rally - a monster could see the character and could call other monsters to aid, there should be a rallying pose and a shockwave type graphic, implying he's just told everyone on screen to mob the player

smite - blessed weapons could deliver a blow to characters that send them flying
